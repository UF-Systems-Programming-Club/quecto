# Quecto Programming Language

This is currently only a simple calculator than can execute expressions with binary operators
\+, \-, \*, and /. However, it is structured in a way to be incrementally added to. There is a tokenizer,
parser, and tree-walking interpreter already in place that merely need to be added on to in order to extend
the language ever further.
